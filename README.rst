LinkedOn
=========

LinkedOn is a Firefox extension that let you create an external database from your navigation on LinkedIn.

Instead of using aggressive technics such as API requests, LinkedOn collects information from your current view.
You just navigate and it reads like you but saves data.

- The main feed
- The users' profiles
- Posts' page
- Company's page
- Company's people page
- Main posts page
- Search result for people
- Your network connection page

Next you can visualize your data and, of course, download as CSV.
